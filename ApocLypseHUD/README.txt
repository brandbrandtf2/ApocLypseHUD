Thank you for checking out my HUD

Before you install my HUD, there are a few things we should cover

I have added the option for 4 different styles of health, these options include

- G-Man G's Box style health bar
- BroeselHUDBlu's Team Colored cross
- The numbers with a small cross to the side, similar to OMP's HUD
- And as always, the plain just numbers similar to broesel HUD, or ray's HUD

Now, if you dont like the colors for the health and ammo, dont worry, you can change them

go to the file location ApocLypseHUD/resource and open the file clientscheme.resource

locate the 2 sections near the top saying "Ammo In Clip", "Ammo In Clip Low", "Health Normal", etc

the way you change the colors are by changing the values coresponding with those color names

the way they are designed is by RGBA color values, if you are familiar with RGB color values, the

"A" is the transparency

for those that dont know

the first set of numbers is the red value, the numbers range from 0-255, 255 being white,

0 being black

the second set of numbers is the green value

the third set is the blue value

and as stated earlier, the fourth set is the transparency, 0 being invisible, 255 being

completely visible, i would suggest not changing these values

now go to this website http://www.colorschemer.com/online.html

and have fun changing them 

the values you change should be pretty self explanatory

"Ammo In Clip" - if you are demo with grenade launcher, the 4 is that

"Ammo In Reserve" - if using the grenade launcher, it would be the 16

"Ammo No Clip" -  is if you are a heavy, sniper, or pyro and your primary has only 1 digit

for the ammo because you dont reload i.e. the 200 of the minigun or flame thrower

the "Ammo In Clip Low" and similar values of the three are obviously the colors used

when you are running low on ammo

for the health

"Health Normal" is the normal health color you have when you are not buffed or damaged severely

"Health Buff" is the health color you have when you are buffed by a medi gun

"Health Hurt" is the color you have when you are severely damaged

if you have any questions, add me on steam.
